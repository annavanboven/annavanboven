## Recent Projects

### :house_with_garden: AI Agents for Interactive Fiction
This project is a continuation from a Natural Language Processing class project started in September, 2021. Our team of four students and our professor built agents using different AI techniques to play Interactice Fiction games, like Zork 1. This is an ongoing project, and the repository is pinned on my profile.

### :two_women_holding_hands: Quizzards
Quizzards is a quiz-based social media site where users can take quizzes, make quizzes, and share results with friends. A team of five of us built this website for our Computer Science Capstone in Spring, 2022. The repository to this project is pinned to my profile.
