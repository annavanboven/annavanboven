# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I am a recent graduate from the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington, where I double majored in Computer Science and Mathematics and gained experience coding on both small-scale and large-scale, long-term projects.

## Recent Projects

### :house_with_garden: AI Agents for Interactive Fiction
This project is a continuation from a Natural Language Processing class project started in September, 2021. Our team of four students and our professor built agents using different AI techniques to play Interactice Fiction games, like Zork 1. This is an ongoing project, and the repository is pinned on my profile.

### :two_women_holding_hands: Quizzards
Quizzards is a quiz-based social media site where users can take quizzes, make quizzes, and share results with friends. A team of five of us built this website for our Computer Science Capstone in Spring, 2022. The repository to this project is pinned to my profile.

##  Algorithms and Data Structures

### :game_die: Minimax Algorithm
**GameSolver**  is an educational website where users can play online games against the computer and learn about the algorithms the computer uses to play. 
The computer uses the Minimax algorithm with a heuristic to play ConnectFour. The user can adjust the depth of minimax exploration on a sliding scale from 1 to 4. 
The computer uses backtracking, or AC3 with backtracking, to complete a sudoku board. This portion of the site was created by Penny Rowe.
This site can be accessed through the (pinned) prowe12/prowe12.github.io repository.

### :mask: Dynamic Time Warping
**DynamicTimeWapring_CovidCompare** uses the DTW algorithm to measure the similarity in temporal sequences. In this case, the sequences are data on thr growth rate of COVID in different states at the beginning of the pandemic.

### :earth_americas: A Star
**A-star_Navigator** uses the A* graph traversal algorithm on a map of the US to find the shortest route connecting two cities.

### :clipboard: Directed Graph
**TaskSorter** takes in a list of tasks, each with prerequisites, and creates a directed graph of the items on the list. It checks whether the graph is cyclic or acyclic, then outputs the order in which to complete the tasks.

## Multithreaded

:bar_chart: **matrix-multiplication** randomly generates two matrices and multiplies them together two times: the first using the number of threads inputted by the user, and the second using a single thread. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the speedup when using multiple threads.

:file_folder: **text-muncher** uses four threads to read in a text file and rewrite the same file with numbered lines and a character count.

:chart_with_downwards_trend: **political-neural-net** is a fairly untrained multithreaded neural network designed to predict a candidate's political affiliation based on how they vote on ten issues. The network uses five threads to propogate data through and one thread to compute the back propogation using mini-batch gradient descent.
